This tool is replacing agvtool.

agvtool was causing Xcode to crash all the time - so I wrote a simple tool that replaces it.  
Takes either -r [path] or list of names of plist files.

For instance

VersioningTool -r ~/Projects/myproject
VersioningTool ~/Projects/myproject/info.plist ~/Projects/myproject/component/info.plist
VersioningTool -r
