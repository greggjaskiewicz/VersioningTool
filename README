This tool is replacing agvtool.

agvtool was causing Xcode to crash all the time - so I wrote a simple tool that replaces it.  
Takes either -r [path] or list of names of plist files.

For instance

VersioningTool -r ~/Projects/myproject
VersioningTool ~/Projects/myproject/info.plist ~/Projects/myproject/component/info.plist
VersioningTool -r

Or in Xcode just add this in the 'custom' script:

/usr/local/bin/VersioningTool "$PRODUCT_SETTINGS_PATH"

Providing of course , that this is where you've installed VersioningTool :)

You have to create "Bundle Version" in the plist file, as string, with initial value 1.


That's it.
